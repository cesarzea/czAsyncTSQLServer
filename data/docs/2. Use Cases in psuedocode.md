# Use cases in pseudocode 

The next three use cases resume the basic functionality, explained in pseudocode and detailed how to implement each use case with that solution.

:>[c=red][i=fa-exclamation-triangle]It must be considered:
:>
:>- A, B, C, A.1, A.2, etc., are SQL statements or stored procedures.
:>- There must be the ability to handle errors.
:>- Encapsulation must be respected. Use cases must run successfully regardless of what other asynchronous processes are running.

# Use case 1

    => async exec A

    END

That is implemented with that solution with the next code: 

<pre data-src='..\data\code\st_useCase_1.sql'></pre>

# Use case 2

Implement a sentence or stored procedure that do the next:

    => async exec sentence A 
    => async exec sentence B 
    => async exec sentence C

    => When A, B and C are finished, then => async exec sentence D.

    END

That is implemented with that solution with the next code:

<pre data-src='..\data\code\st_useCase_2.sql'></pre>


# Use case 3

    => async exec sentence A
        => When A is finished: 
            => async exec sentence A.1
            => async exec sentence A.2
    => async exec sentence B
        => When B is finished:
            => async exec sentence B.1
            => async exec sentence B.2
    => async exec sentence C

    => When A, B and C and their subprocesses A.1, A.2, B.2 and B2 are finished, then => exec async exec sentence D.

    END

That is implemented with that solution with the next code:

<pre data-src='..\data\code\st_useCase_3.sql'></pre>

<pre data-src='..\data\code\st_useCase_3_next_steps.sql'></pre>
