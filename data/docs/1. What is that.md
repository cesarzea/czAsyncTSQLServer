# T-SQL Advanced Asynchronous Programing?

In this contribution I will explain the solution I use for the asynchronous execution of statements and stored procedures in T-SQL.

It is a solution that I wish I had had for many years until I managed to solve it: not only be able to execute several asynchronous T-SQL statements or procedures, but also be able to continue executing other statements when the asynchronous statements had finished, knowing when was erroros, passing extra info, etc. 

That is an example that can be implemented with that solution with an easy code:

It is a solution that I have used many times, so I consider it reliable.

# Examples where I used it

I have used this solution, or previous versions, on projects such as:

- Many optimizations of query heavy data processing executions to make the most of all CPU cores of the server.
- Several high-performance BI report generation servers on demand, where a massive number of users should be able to request the generation of long-run time reports to be generated offline without overloading the server and limiting the number of reports generated simultaneously.
- Implementation of SQL Server Git solution to automatically log database schema changes to Git repositories.
- Datawarehouse and BI systems.
- A system for the transmission of large volumes of data in an ultra fast way between SQL Server servers.
- An utility for using SalesForce bridges from T-SQL.
- Etc.

I hope to have time to share some of these solutions soon.

I consider this solution so useful that it is rare to work SQL Server where I don’t use it.  Once you get used to using it, it will become part of your regular work and you will use asynchronous executions with the same ease as you do any other T-SQL task.

I can certainly say that being able to count on it will greatly elevate your data processing skills in SQL Server.

# Ok, but ... Advanced?

The solutions I’ve seen on the Internet so far provide asynchronous programming, and in fact this solution I started implementing years ago based on some found on the Internet. However, I didn’t find any solution that would allow working with asynchronous processes in T-SQL like working with threads in C, Java or Node. Js. 

The goal I set myself in developing this solution was none other than those that the development needs imposed on me in order to be effective in the projects I carried out. Therefore, it is not an academic paper that aims to cover all possible functionalities of multi-threading, but at least the described in the use cases section.

For obvious security reasons, the proposed solution does not run any COM or .Net add-ons, nor does it use any other resources than those provided by SQL Server. The only feature that has to be enabled in your database that is not enabled by default is the use of Service Broker.

# The problem

T-SQL does not provide a direct solution to execute stored procedures asynchronously that is comfortable to use in our code, as they do have C, Java, Node, etc.

The situations where a T-SQL developer wants to be able to execute asynchronous statements are very varied and I think that everyone who has spent time working with T-SQL understands the problem, so I will explain what this contribution solves:

I want to be able to do the following:

- starts the execution of the A statement asynchronously.
- starts the execution of the B statement asynchronously.
- starts the execution of the C statement asynchronously.
- When statements A, B, and C have finished, execute statement D.
  
And taking into account that:

- If an error occurs in A, B or C, D must be able to know it.
- Any statement executed asynchronously can also execute other statements asynchronously, so a statement will not be considered completed until it has finished and also all the asynchronous statements that it has launched, or have launched its asynchronous statements, but it must also be possible to run asynchronous procedures in separate threads that break out of this logic.

That is, to be able to trust that D will be executed only when A, B and C have finished everything that A, B and C execute and not before and thus provide SQL Sever with an asynchronous execution solution that can be used comfortably from T- SQL.

Continue reading the Use Cases to continue understanding the solution, and then, the section 'The Solution', where is resolved each use case with that solution. 

The section 'How implement it' describe step by step how implement that solution in your servers. 

# Next future features.

The next feature I want to implement is the ability to specify the Service Broker queue to be used for each asynchronous call to be able to be used in the most biggest and distributed systems.
